### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Zuri Klascha, I'm a student, developer and creative from WÃ¼rzburg Germany.

I primarily develop websites, plugins for Adobe XD and developer tooling, but also individual web- and desktop apps.

When I'm not developing things, I study space- and aerospace computer science in WÃ¼rzburg, Germany, lead the team that develops the Ground Station Software for the [Daedalus2 WÃ¼Space Project](https://www.wuespace.de/daedalus/) and more.

#### Apart from that
I have autism (and try to fight against prejudice in this field).
